# This is the configuration file for the Subsonic service
# (/etc/init.d/subsonic)
#
# To change the startup parameters of Subsonic, modify
# the SUBSONIC_ARGS variable below.
#
# Type "subsonic --help" on the command line to read an
# explanation of the different options.
#
# For example, to specify that Subsonic should use port 80 (for http)
# and 443 (for https), and use a Java memory heap size of 200 MB, use
# the following:
#
# SUBSONIC_ARGS="--port=80 --https-port=443 --max-memory=200"

SUBSONIC_ARGS="--max-memory=150 --https-port=8443 --port=8080 --host=0.0.0.0 -Dsubsonic.ssl.keystore=/var/subsonic/subsonic.keystore -Dsubsonic.ssl.password=subsonic"

# The user which should run the Subsonic process. Default "root".
# Note that non-root users are by default not allowed to use ports
# below 1024. Also make sure to grant the user write permissions in
# the music directories, otherwise changing album art and tags will fail.
